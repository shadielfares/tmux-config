# Tmux Config üéõÔ∏è

Welcome to my Tmux configuration repository! This setup is designed to enhance the functionality of Tmux, particularly in conjunction with Neovim, by allowing for additional panes and improved workflow integration.

## Features ‚ú®
- Custom Tmux configuration tailored for Neovim users
- Efficient pane management
- Enhanced productivity with streamlined shortcuts

## Text Copying Issues üìã
When working with terminal multiplexers like tmux, especially in conjunction with Neovim, copying text can be challenging. This is a common problem that many users encounter when trying to copy text from tmux panes to the system clipboard.

For a detailed explanation of this issue, see [nvim-config issue #3](https://github.com/shadielfares/nvim-config/issues/3) which describes the copying problem in detail.

### Solution: tmux-yank Plugin
To solve this copying issue, we recommend installing the [tmux-yank plugin](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-yank). This plugin enables copying to the system clipboard from tmux copy mode.

**Installation:**
1. Add the plugin to your tmux.conf:
   ```
   set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-yank'
   ```
2. Reload tmux configuration and install the plugin using `<Prefix> + I`

**Usage:**
- Enter copy mode with `<Prefix> + [`
- Select text with `v` (visual mode) or use mouse selection
- Copy to clipboard with `y` (copies to system clipboard)

## Prerequisites üìã
- Ensure you have Tmux installed on your system. You can install it using your package manager, for example:
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install tmux
    ```

    ```
4. Download the newly added packages, using the command (Note: You must be currently editing the tmux.conf file in tmux):
    ```

    ```

## Usage üöÄ
